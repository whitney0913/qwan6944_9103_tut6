**Part1:Imaging Technique Inspirationt**
1. Inspired Imaging Technique
   I was inspired by the "Bonsai Tree" design project on the happycoding website.

2. Aspects and benefits of the project
   The project is characterized by its random leaf growth effect and interactive pruning function. By mimicking the scene of a blooming bonsai tree in nature, viewers can feel the dynamic process of tree growth, and they are able to trim the leaves by clicking on the circle, which increases the fun and participation of the project. Drawing on the graphic techniques of the 'Bonsai Tree' project, I plan to introduce this dynamic, interactive element to Anwar Jalal Shemza's 'Apple Tree' work. In this way, the 'Apple Tree' can be infused with more energy and emotion.

3. high-quality screenshots

**Part2:Coding Technique Exploration**
1. Coding Technique
   Using p5.js library and JavaScript programming language.

2. Role of coding technology
   In order to effectively achieve the desired results in the "Bonsai Tree" project. p5.js provides a wealth of drawing and interactive features. For example, through the custom methods`maybeGrow()`and`grow()`, can simulate the growth process of the tree .I can use p5.js drawing functions to draw various parts of the tree, such as the trunk, leaves and branches. At the same time, using p5.js interactive features, custom function`getClickedNode ()`, can click on the leaves to prune the interactive effect. This coding technique allowed us to implement some of the functionality needed in the "Apple Tree" project, adding dynamism and interest to the artwork.
