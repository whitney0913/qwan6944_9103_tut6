**Part1:Imaging Technique Inspirationt**
1. Inspired Imaging Technique
   I was inspired by the "Bonsai Tree" design project on the happycoding website.

2. Aspects and benefits of the project
   The project is characterized by its random leaf growth effect and interactive pruning function. By mimicking the scene of a blooming bonsai tree in nature, viewers can feel the dynamic process of tree growth, and they are able to trim the leaves by clicking on the circle, which increases the fun and participation of the project. Drawing on the graphic techniques of the 'Bonsai Tree' project, I plan to introduce this dynamic, interactive element to Anwar Jalal Shemza's 'Apple Tree' work. In this way, the 'Apple Tree' can be infused with more energy and emotion.

3. high-quality screenshots
